Here’s a developer-ready screen skeleton for Spott (Android-first, Material 3, Kotlin/Compose). It’s ordered from a brand-new user’s first launch through to the Home (map) experience, and then the rest of the Driver + Host surfaces. I’ve included concrete UI components per screen so engineers/designers can align quickly. Authentication = Firebase Auth; maps = Google Maps Compose. (References to requirements come from your PRD.)

Notes tying back to your PRD

Top Spott highlight + ranking is a first-class UI element on Home.

Chat is booking-scoped only, opens T-60 min before start, auto-archives +24h: Inbox and Thread follow this lifecycle.

KYC + Connect strictly gate listing visibility; wizard’s final step and Hub state reflect this.

Entrance coordinates (not just address) are shown/used in Navigation & cards.

Receipts surface from booking details (Stripe).

If you’d like, I can drop this into a one-pager “Screen Matrix” (route → purpose → primary components → states) or a clickable FIGMA-ready checklist.
